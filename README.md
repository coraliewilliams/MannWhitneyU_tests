# MannWhitneyU_tests

### Comparisons of Mann-Whitney U tests outputs across different statistical packages. 

Mann-Whitney U test is the nonparametric equivalent of Student’s t test to compare two groups of continuous observations that are not normally distributed. A common misconception is that Mann-Whitney U test does not test for equality of group medians but rather tests for equality of group mean ranks.
