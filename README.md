# MannWhitneyU_tests

### Comparisons of Mann-Whitney U tests outputs across different statistical packages. 

Mann-Whitney U test is the nonparametric equivalent of Student’s t test to compare two groups of continuous observations that are not normally distributed. Mann-Whitney U test is described in the literature also as Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A common misconception is that Mann-Whitney U test does not test for equality of group medians but rather tests for equality of group mean ranks.

There are three factors that can vary when implementing the Mann-Whitney U test and it’s significance [1]:

#### 1) Large-sample (asymptotic/normal) approximation:
There are two options to calculate the significance values:
By exact permutation: preferred when sample sizes are small. When there are no ties the null distribution of Wilcoxon rank-sum statistic uses the total number of observations in both samples
Large sample (asymptotic/normal) approximation: described for sample sizes bigger than 10.

#### 2) Continuity correction:
When normal approximation is used this correction accounts for the discrete distribution of the Mann-Whitney U statistic (and not continuous as the normal distribution). 

#### 3) Ties and correction for ties:
Observations having equal values are assigned the mean rank across the tie. When a tie is found in the same observation group no correction is needed. When a tie is within the two observation groups the asymptotic/normal approximation is too conservative. As such the correction adjusts the z statistics and renders less conservation (smaller) p-values.
